# Who moved my Trust Boundary?

- _µServices Expose Hidden Boundaries_
- _Increased Testing Flexibility: Types & Levels_
- _Tradeoff: Comprehensiveness vs. Criticality, Lifespan_
- _Possible with Monolith, but Easier with µServices_

# _NON_Functional

- _acceptable latency of a web page_
- _number of users a system should support_
- _how accessible a system is to people w/ disabilities_
- _how secure customer data should be_
