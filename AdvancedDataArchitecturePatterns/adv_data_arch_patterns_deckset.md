Dive into Bounded Contexts

Set up FluffBox Architecture

---

Describe three main challenges:

* Spanning Transactions
* Data Synchronizaion
* Spanning Queries

Why are these challenges? We've created a distributed system...

# Spanning Transactions

TODO: come up with a use case for FluffBox

---

# Data Synchronizaion

TODO: come up with a use case for FluffBox

---

# Spanning Querues

TODO: come up with a use case for FluffBox (intelligent logistics?)

Two-Phase Commit

---

Discuss AP

Discuss Eventual Consistency

Compensating Transactions

- these can be bad because they create coupling

---

Event-Driven Architecture

---

Solution #1: Raw Events

Can address:

* Spanning Transactions (noodle this one a bit)
* Data Synchronizaion

---

Rub a Message broker on it...

---

Pros/Cons of Solution #1

---

Solution #2: Event Sourcing/CQRS

Can address:

* Spanning Transactions
* Data Synchronizaion
* Spanning Queries

---

Event Sourcing?

---

CQRS?

---

Data Stores...

Kafka
EventStore
Datomic

---

App Frameworks

Axon
Jdon

---

Pros/Cons of Solution #2

---

Solution #3: Streaming

Can address:

* Data Synchronizaion (noodle)
* Spanning Queries

---

Lambda Architecture

---

Kappa Architecture
