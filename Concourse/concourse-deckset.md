# What is Concourse?

- Open Source CI Pipeline system
- Developed by Pivotal
- [http://concourse.ci](http://concourse.ci)

---

# Because the world needed another CI system...
# [fit] 0_o

---

# [fit] Why?
![](images/concourse-new-small.jpg)

---

# [fit] Simplicity

^ - shouldn't have to know the guts
- should be able to learn in one sitting
- 3 primitives - tasks/resources/jobs - allow the expression of arbitrary features and pipelines

---

# [fit] Usability

^ - UI optimized for get me where I want to go as fast as possible

---

# [fit] Build Isolation
![](../Common/images/docker-logo.png)

^ - death to build pollution!
- builds run in containers
- everyone can share workers and never worry about cross-contamination

---

# [fit] Scalable/Reproducible deployment
![inline](../Common/images/bosh-architecture.png)

http://bosh.io

^ - no snowflakes!
- statically configured -  can always be recreated from scratch with a single BOSH deploy
- If your deployment's infrastructure burns down, just deploy it somewhere else.
- scale up/down by bumping a number in your BOSH manifest

---

# [fit] Flexibility

^ - almost nothing supported in the core (the anti-Jenkins)
- integrations with other things implemented using resource abstraction

---

# [fit] _Local_
# [fit] Iteration

^ - run concourse locally
- yak shave tasks using local execution and the fly CLI
- have confidence that local builds are identical to remote builds
- keep your commit history clean of junk

---

# [fit] Concepts
![](images/concourse-new-small.jpg)

---

# Running Example:

- Consumer-Driven Contract Testing ([http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html](http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html))
- Using Pact-JVM ([https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm](https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm))
- Example Project ([https://github.com/mstine/microservices-pact](https://github.com/mstine/microservices-pact))

# Built-In Resources
## [http://concourse.ci/resource-types.html](http://concourse.ci/resource-types.html)

- The git resource can pull and push to git repositories.
- The time resource can start jobs on a schedule or timestamp outputs.
- The s3 resource can fetch from and upload to S3 buckets.
- The archive resource can fetch and extract .tar.gz archives.
- The semver resource can set or bump version numbers.
- The github-release resource can fetch and publish versioned GitHub resources.
- The docker-image resource can fetch, build, and push Docker images
- The tracker resource can deliver stories and bugs on Pivotal Tracker
- The pool resource allows you to configure how to serialize use of an external system. This lets you prevent test interference or overwork on shared systems.
- The cf resource can deploy an application to Cloud Foundry.
- The bosh-io-release resource can track and fetch new BOSH releases from bosh.io.
- The bosh-io-stemcell resource can track and fetch new BOSH stemcells from bosh.io.
- The bosh-deployment resource can deploy BOSH stemcells and releases.
- The vagrant-cloud resource can fetch and publish Vagrant boxes to Atlas.

# [fit] Implement Your Own

- Docker Image w/ 3 Scripts
- `/opt/resource/check`
- `/opt/resource/in`
- `/opt/resource/out`
- Add to your Concourse deploy via `resource_types` section in pipeline config:

```
resource_types:
- name: pivnet
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: pivotalcf/pivnet-resource
    tag: latest-final

# [fit] Jobs
# [fit] _functions composed of behavior (tasks) and inputs/outputs (resources/other jobs)_

---

# Jobs Have Builds

- Success (all tasks succeed)
- Failure (any task fails)
- Can be accessed while running/shortly after finish (intercept/hijack)

---

# Jobs Have Plans

- Sequence of steps to execute:
- _get_ resources
- run things (_task_)
- _put_ resources
- parallel or serial

---

# Verify Pact (inputs)

```
- get: microservices-pact
  passed: [generate-pact]
  trigger: true
- get: foo-provider-version
  params: {bump: minor, pre: alpha}
- get: pact
  passed: [generate-pact]
  trigger: true
```

^ - passed - only run things that have passed upstream build
- trigger - new versions of resource should kick this build
- bumping versions

---

# Verify Pact (function)

```
- task: verify-pact
  file: microservices-pact/microservices-pact-provider/task.yml
```

^ CI config side-by-side with project!

# [fit] Let's Play
![](images/concourse-new-small.jpg)

^ Demonstrate loading the pipeline
Demonstrate modifying the pipeline
Demonstrate intercepting the container
Poke around with the BOSH deployment, scale up/down workers
Examine resource types in the pipeline
Examine job types in the pipeline
Kick off builds by pushing code to github
Demonstrate intercepting the container
Pipeline examples: SCS, Concourse itself

---

# Intercepting with Fly

Intercepting a Job Step
```
fly -t <target> intercept -j <pipeline>/<job> -b <build #> -s <step>
```

Intercepting a Resource
```
fly -t <target> intercept --check <pipeline>/<resource> /bin/sh
```
